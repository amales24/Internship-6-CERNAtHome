# Internship-6-CERNAtHome

TASK: 
Create a database for CERN following instructions below. <br />
Each accelerator is tied to one or more projects and each project can be tied to one or more accelerators (or none). <br />
For each project there ara multiple scientific papers, but each paper has to be written on exactly one project. We track the number of citations for each paper. <br />
Multiple scientists can collaborate on the same paper, just as one scientist can contribute to multiple papers. <br />
Relevant information about scientists: date of birth, country (name, population and PPP/capita), gender and profession (programmer, physicist, engineer or material scientist). While at CERN, scientists live in hotels (that have a specified capacity), most of which are in Geneva.
